- My intended platform for final project is iOS.
- My intended programming language for the final project is Swift. 
- I am currently not planning to explore cross-platform development 

I chose iOS because I currently use an iPhone, and I believe it will be easier to do smoke testing on any app I create if I have a device I can test it on. 
Swift programming language works the best for developing iOS apps because it was intentionally creating with iOS in mind. 
I am unsure about cross-platform development currently because I believe just developing for 1 platform will be a big project for me.
